            <p>I created this project during my free time using Ibis X as a way to enhance my creative skills and experiment with new tools and techniques. It was a fun and engaging process that allowed me to push my boundaries and explore the full potential of the software. By trying out different features and workflows, I gained a deeper understanding of the platform and discovered innovative ways to bring my ideas to life. This project not only served as a creative outlet but also as an opportunity to grow and refine my expertise in digital art.</p>
