            <p>I hosted a photobooth event where I took charge of designing custom frames, posters, and free gifts entirely by myself using Illustrator and Photoshop. From conceptualizing the visuals to creating designs that matched the event's theme, this experience allowed me to showcase my creativity while ensuring everything felt cohesive and professional.

                Through this project, managing the entire creative process taught me valuable lessons in time management, attention to detail, and how design can enhance audience engagement at events</p>
